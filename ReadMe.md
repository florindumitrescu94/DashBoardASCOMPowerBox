		Driver based on wittinobi's driver to accomodate my Arduino code. This driver contains code to read the environmental sensor (DHT22), control two PWM outputs for dew heaters, measure and display power consumption stats (voltage, current, power) and control one relay (connected to four DC Jacks, in my case. Arduino code is in the INO folder. <br>
